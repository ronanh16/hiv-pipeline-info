Usage Guide
1)	Download/clone my revised form of the pipeline from the repository
2)	Set up working directory containing folders named “input”, “output” and “tools”
3)	pangenome.sh should be in this directory, the other scripts should be in “tools”, the desired input fastq files should be in “input”. “output” should be empty.
4)	Open docker and ensure sufficient memory limit (I used 64GB but this might be excessive)
5)	Open pangenome.sh and edit the script to process the barcode of choice
6)	In terminal, change directory to the desired working directory containing pangenome.sh
7)	Enter the command “./pangenome.sh”
Transferable to singularity by replacing docker –run with singularity commands.
